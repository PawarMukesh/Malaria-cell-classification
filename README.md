# AI PROJECT ON MALARIA CELL DETECTOR

## INTRODUCTION:
Malaria is one of the most serious and widespread parasitic disease of humans. The clinical symptoms of malaria are manifested when parasites invade and multiply inside human red cells.
When a malaria-carrying mosquito bites a human host, the malaria parasite enters the bloodstream, multiplies in the liver cells, and is then released back into the bloodstream, where it infects and destroys red blood cells.

## PARASITIZED & UNINFECTED CELL

DATA SUMMARY:
This dataset contains 27560 png images of malaria Parasitized & uninfected cells.The images are grouped into 2 classes. There are 13780 images in each class.

### Classes
1. Parasitized
2. Uninfected

## TASK: BINARY CLASSIFICATION
